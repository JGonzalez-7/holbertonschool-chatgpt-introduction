# ChatGPT Debugging and Automation

This project explores two pivotal aspects of software development—debugging and automation—using ChatGPT as a co-pilot.

## What You Will Do
- Debugging: Use ChatGPT to spot, explain, and fix errors across multiple languages.
- Automation: Generate boilerplate code, documentation, and basic tests to streamline repetitive work.

## Outcomes
- Enhanced debugging skills through clearer articulation of issues and AI-assisted fixes.
- Automation proficiency that improves productivity and code quality.
